2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-3#1 Warning
CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Property  
The CONFIG_VOLTAGE property is not set for current_design. To indicate what the configuration bank VCCO will be, the CONFIG_VOLTAGE property must be set to 1.5, 1.8, 2.5, or 3.3.  Refer to device configuration user guide for more information.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net CPU/my_prog_rom/OUT_FLAG_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin CPU/my_prog_rom/s_c_reg_i_2/O, cell CPU/my_prog_rom/s_c_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_db_L_INT/bounce_counter/s_l_int is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_db_L_INT/bounce_counter/s_int_port[2]_i_1/O, cell my_db_L_INT/bounce_counter/s_int_port[2]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_db_R_INT/bounce_counter/s_r_int is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_db_R_INT/bounce_counter/s_int_port_reg[1]_LDC_i_2/O, cell my_db_R_INT/bounce_counter/s_int_port_reg[1]_LDC_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net my_db_shoot/bounce_counter/s_int_port_reg[1]_P is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin my_db_shoot/bounce_counter/s_int_port_reg[1]_LDC_i_1/O, cell my_db_shoot/bounce_counter/s_int_port_reg[1]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT my_db_L_INT/bounce_counter/s_int_port[2]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    s_int_port_reg[0]_P {FDPE}
    s_int_port_reg[1]_P {FDPE}
    s_int_port_reg[2] {FDCE}

Related violations: <none>
